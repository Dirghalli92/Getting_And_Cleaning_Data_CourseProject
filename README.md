# Getting_And_Cleaning_Data_CourseProject

The script "run_analysis.R" processes a specific data-set while executing the following as per assignment requirements:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Sets up descriptive names for activities in the data-set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. Writes an independent, tidy data 'tidy_data.txt' set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.




For more information regarding variables & the Data-set see the Code_Book file
