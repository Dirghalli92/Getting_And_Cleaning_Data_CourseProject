### Overview of Data

Description of information provided in Data-Set

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who participated in the experiment.

### Script Overview:

1. Reads & Writes tables from the downloaded .zip file utilizing the following files:

* features.txt
* activity_labels.txt
* subject_train.txt
* x_train.txt
* y_train.txt
* subject_test.txt
* x_test.txt
* y_test.txt

3. Combines train/test data-sets into respective variables:

*subject
*-activity
*features

3. Assigns column names and merge to create one data set

4. Pulls Mean and Standard Deviation for each measurement

5. Assigns appropriate Descriptive Names to Activity Fields

6. Restructures Syntax for Clarity while reading using logical syntax as well as removing superfluous characters

7. As per instructions creates and writes a tidy data 'tidy_data.txt' to working directory
* Tidy data set contains only the average for each variable, of each activity, for each subject
